<h1>Module 5: Objects and Classes</h1>
<h4>A. The <span class="courier">String</span> Class</h4>
<p>In Java, there is a class named <span class="inlinecode">String</span>, which implements strings of characters, such as names and addresses. We have seen in previous sections the way to declare and create an object:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">String address = new String("ABC");</pre>
<p>One way to create two strings, <span class="inlinecode">s1</span> and <span class="inlinecode">s2</span>, which contain the values <span class="inlinecode">ABC</span> and <span class="inlinecode">DEF</span>, is shown in the following code fragment.</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">String s1 = new String("ABC");
String s2 = new String("DEF");</pre>
<p><a href="../popups/using_new_with_string_objects.html" class="popup">But we do not always have to use the <span class="courier">new</span> operator with a <span class="courier">String</span></a>.</p>
<p>One more thing to note is the difference between <span class="inlinecode">Strings</span> and <span class="inlinecode">chars</span>. A <span class="inlinecode">char</span> is a primitive and exists in the Java language itself. It is a single data value (a single <span class="inlinecode">char</span>) of fixed size. In Java, when a <span class="inlinecode">char</span> is used as a literal, it is enclosed in single quotes. For example:</p>
<p class="onetabindent">the literal <span class="inlinecode">'A'</span> is a <span class="inlinecode">char</span></p>
<p>A <span class="inlinecode">String </span>is an object that is made up of one or more <span class="inlinecode">chars</span>. Even if the <span class="inlinecode">String </span> has only one <span class="inlinecode">char</span> in it, the <span class="inlinecode">String </span>is still an object and has the behavior of objects that will be defined in the next section. In Java, when a <span class="inlinecode">String</span> is used as a literal, it is enclosed in double quotes. For example:</p>
<p class="onetabindent">the literal <span class="inlinecode">"A"</span> is a <span class="inlinecode">String</span></p>
<p>In II-D, we discussed object methods. As with class methods, it is often necessary to state explicitly which object the method is to use. Once again, the . (dot) operator is used to specify the particular object that is to be used for the method. Just as with class methods, the left-hand side of the <span class="inlinecode">.</span> (dot) operator is the object to use, and the right-hand side is the method to be called. The following code fragment illustrates this point:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">String sb1 = new String("ABC");
String sb2 = new String("DEFGHI");
System.out.println("The third character of sb1 is " + sb1.charAt(2));
System.out.println("The third character of sb2 is " + sb2.charAt(2));</pre>
<p>In the code above, the <span class="inlinecode">charAt</span> method of the <span class="inlinecode">String </span>class is run twice, and in each case the third character is taken from the <span class="inlinecode">String</span>. (Note that the index for the <span class="inlinecode">String</span> ranges from 0 to <span class="inlinecode">length()</span> &ndash; 1. The first <span class="inlinecode">char</span> in the <span class="inlinecode">String</span> is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on.)</p>
<p>In the first <span class="inlinecode">println</span> statement, the method <span class="inlinecode">charAt</span>, which is on the right-hand side of the <span class="inlinecode">.</span> (dot) operator, retrieves the third character from the <span class="inlinecode">String sb1</span>, which is on the left-hand side of the <span class="inlinecode">. </span> (dot) operator. Because <span class="inlinecode">sb1</span> contains the <span class="inlinecode">String ABC</span>, the third character, <span class="inlinecode">C</span>, is printed.</p>
<p>In the second <span class="inlinecode">println</span> statement, the method <span class="inlinecode">charAt</span>, which is on the right-hand side of the <span class="inlinecode">.</span> (dot) operator, retrieves the third character from the <span class="inlinecode">String sb2</span>, which is on the left-hand side of the <span class="inlinecode">.</span> (dot) operator. Because <span class="inlinecode">sb2</span> contains the <span class="inlinecode">String ABC</span>, the third character, <span class="inlinecode">F</span>, is printed.</p>
<p>To use an instance method, it is necessary to first allocate an object to provide a context for that method. For example, consider the following code fragment:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">String sb1;
System.out.println("The third character of sb1 is "
                    + sb1.charAt(3));  // Invalid</pre>
<p>This code fragment does not make sense because there is no <span class="inlinecode">String</span> to query for the third character. This situation is very different from trying to access a character outside of the range of the <span class="inlinecode">String</span>. Attempting to call a method on an object that has not been initialized never makes sense and will always result in a <em>null reference exception</em>. Because exceptions will not be covered in this course, you may consider an exception to be an error message.</p>
<p>Some examples of using <span class="inlinecode">String</span> methods are presented in the following program. Move your mouse over OUTPUT to see what is printed.</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">/* File:    UMUC_ShowString.java
 * Author:  InstructorX
 * Date:    dd-mm-yyyy
 * Purpose: Show some string functions
 */

public class UMUC_ShowString {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      String s1 = new String("ABCDEF");
      String s2 = new String("UVWXYZ");

      // c1 is set to D, the character in
      // s1 at position 3
      char c1 = s1.charAt(3);
      System.out.println("c = " + c1); // <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[25])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><strong>OUTPUT</strong></span></a>

      // c1 is set to X, the character in
      // s2 at position 3
      c1 = s2.charAt(3);
      System.out.println("c = " + c1); // <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[26])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><strong>OUTPUT</strong></span></a>
          
      // s3 is set to CDE, a substring of s1 from
      // positions 2 to 5
      String s3 = s1.substring(2,5);
      System.out.println(s3);          // <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[27])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><strong>OUTPUT</strong></span></a>
      
   } // end method
} // end class</pre>
<p>A complete catalog of all <span class="inlinecode">String</span> methods can be found in the Java API located at java.sun.com.</p>
<p>We will now discuss one other important method in the <span class="inlinecode">String </span> class&mdash;the <span class="inlinecode">equals</span> method. Recall that the <span class="inlinecode">==</span> operator is used in Java to compare two objects to see if they are the same. This comparison is called <em>equality</em>.</p>
<p>There are times, however, when what is to be checked is not that the <em> objects</em> are the same, but that the <em>values</em> contained in the objects are the same. If the values in the two objects are the same, it is said that the objects are <em>equivalent</em>. For example, consider the following program:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">/* File:     UMUC_TestString.java
 * Author:   InstructorX
 * Date:     dd-mm-yyyy
 * Purpose:  Test two strings for equality and equivalence
 */
   
public class UMUC_TestString {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      String s1 = new String("ABC");
      String s2 = s1;
      String s3 = new String("ABC");

      if (s1 == s2)
         System.out.println("s1 and s2 are equal");      // <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[28])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><strong>OUTPUT</strong></span></a>
      if (s1.equals(s2))
         System.out.println("s1 and s2 are equivalent"); // <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[29])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><strong>OUTPUT</strong></span></a>
      if (s1 == s3)
         System.out.println("s1 and s3 are equal");
      if (s1.equals(s3))
         System.out.println("s1 and s3 are equivalent"); // <a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[30])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"><strong>OUTPUT</strong></span></a>
   } // end method
} // end class
</pre>
<p>In this program, <span class="inlinecode">Strings s1</span> and <span class="inlinecode">s2</span> are equal (they refer to the same object). Because they refer to the same object, that object must have the same value, so they are also equivalent.</p>
<p><span class="inlinecode">Strings s1</span> and <span class="inlinecode">s3</span> refer to different objects, so they are not equal. The <span class="inlinecode">Strings s1</span> and <span class="inlinecode">s3</span> have the same data, however, so these <span class="inlinecode">Strings</span> are equivalent.</p>
<p>In summation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If two variables represent the same object, they are equal and equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two variables represent different objects that have the same values, they are not equal but are equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two variables represent different objects that have different values, they are neither equal nor equivalent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>B. The <span class="courier">Character</span> Class</h4>
<p>In I-D, we introduced wrapper classes found in the <span class="inlinecode">java.lang</span> package. Although the two examples applied to only doubles and integers, there are wrapper classes for all of the primitive data types. The <span class="inlinecode">Character</span> class has several methods that allow the manipulation of characters. For example, we can compare two characters and determine if they are equal.</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">Character char1 = new Character('a');
Character char2 = new Character('b');
char1.compareTo(char2);    // returns 1 because they are 1 unit apart
char1.equals(char2);       // returns false because they are not equal
</pre>
<p>Other methods will allow us to determine if the character is a letter or a digit, or if it is uppercase or lowercase. Two methods will return either a lowercase or an uppercase character. If the <span class="inlinecode">Character</span> class is used with the <span class="inlinecode">String</span> class, it is possible to conduct several operations on the contents of the string.</p>
