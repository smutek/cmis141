<h1>Module 5: Objects and Classes</h1>
<p>The <span class="inlinecode">StringBuffer</span> class is located in the <span class="inlinecode">java.lang</span> package. A major difference between the <span class="inlinecode">String</span> class and the <span class="inlinecode">StringBuffer</span> class is found in the flexibility of the latter. Once a <span class="inlinecode">String</span> object&rsquo;s value has been created, it cannot be changed. <span class="inlinecode">StringBuffer</span>, however, has the ability to change the contents by adding, inserting, or appending new material into the string buffer, as shown below.</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
sb.append("Hello");   // inserting a string (Hello)
sb.append(' ');       // appending a character space
sb.append("World.");  // appending a string (World.)
</pre>
<p>Suppose we would like to change the period after <span class="inlinecode">World</span> to an exclamation point. After <span class="inlinecode">Hello World.</span> has been put into the object, <span class="inlinecode">sb</span>, the period is in the 11<sup>th</sup> position. Because the index runs from 0 to 11 in this string, we use the following code fragment to delete the period:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">sb.deleteCharAt(11);  // deletes the period in the 11th position
</pre>
<p>The result is that the string is now <span class="inlinecode">Hello World</span> and we can append the exclamation point correctly at the end:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">sb.append("!");  // appends the exclamation point 
</pre>
<p>Now the string contains:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">Hello World!
</pre>
<p>There are many other methods found in <span class="inlinecode">StringBuffer</span> that allow us to manipulate strings.</p>
<p>When JDK 1.5 became available, the <span class="inlinecode">StringBuilder</span> class was introduced. It is almost the same as <span class="inlinecode">StringBuffer</span> and so may be used in its place. <span class="inlinecode">StringBuilder</span> is normally used when it is to be accessed by a single task. <span class="inlinecode">StringBuffer</span> can be accessed by multiple tasks.</p>
