<p>Welcome to week 7 in CMIS 141. Once again, there are multiple activities for you to participate. To be successful, it is critical that you read and complete all of these activities. Consider using this document as checklist of items to complete and roadmap for learning the materials.</p>
<p>The activities for this week include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Content</strong> - This module provides the technical details supporting your learning. You should carefully read these modules trying the activities and exercises embedded in the materials:</p>
<p>&nbsp; a. More on Strings - This sub-module describes how to use the String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes in Java.</p>
<p>&nbsp; b. Dates in Java - This sub-module use classes within the java.time package found in Java 8 and higher.</p>
<p>c. Command Line Arguments &ndash; This sub-modules describes how to use command line arguments to send data into a Java application.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Hands-On Lab</strong> - After reading all the competencies, this hands-on lab will walk you through each major concept demonstrating the functionality in Java. There are three hands-on exercises including:</p>
<p>a. Compare, contrast and use the String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes</p>
<p>b. Use classes in the java.time package</p>
<p>c. Use command line arguments in Java</p>
<p>Each of these exercises includes a demonstration using Java code as well as exercises for you to complete to become comfortable using the concepts covered in the Competencies module.</p>
<p><strong>5. Code Examples</strong> - This module provides the actual Java code used in the hand-on lab for this week. These may save you some time as you can use the code as opposed to copying and pasting from the hands-on lab document.</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; Code Solutions</strong> - This module provides possible solutions to the exercises in the hands-on lab for this week. You should try to solve each exercise yourself first before looking at the solution. However, if you get stuck, these should help get you passed the issue. Keep in mind, there are hundreds of possible solutions to these exercises. These&nbsp;solutions represent just one possible solution.</p>
<p><strong>7. Assignments</strong> - This week you need to respond to a discussion item on creating a Java application to use command line arguments to generate random numbers. There is also a homework assignment with programming projects to be completed and submitted.</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong><strong><strong>Questions -&nbsp;</strong></strong>Post any questions in the "Ask the Professor" discussions area.<strong></strong></p>
