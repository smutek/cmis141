<h1>Module 5: Objects and Classes</h1>
<p>We have seen in the previous sections how to create a class. In module 3, we worked with the implicitly imported class <span class="inlinecode">Math</span> and the method <span class="inlinecode">pow</span> to raise a number to its power as shown in the code fragment below:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">Math.pow(2,3); // raises 2 to the 3</pre>
<p><sup>rd</sup></p>
<pre class="code onetabindent"> power = 8</pre>
<p>Also found in that class is a method called <span class="inlinecode">random</span>, which generates a random number as a double in the range 0.0 &lt; 1.0. Suppose we want to generate five random numbers in the range 20 &lt;= 29 that are integers rather than doubles. We could use type casting and the <span class="inlinecode">random</span> method as in the following code fragment:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">for (int count = 0; count &lt; 5; count++){
   System.out.print (20 + (int)(Math.random() * 10) + "  ");
}
</pre>
<p>The five random numbers would be generated from the following values:</p>
<p class="onetabindent">20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29</p>
<p>Another way to obtain random values is to use the <span class="inlinecode">Random</span> class found in the <span class="inlinecode">java.util</span> package. There are two ways to use this class. One way is to use the current elapse time as the seed. The other way is to use a specified seed.</p>
<p>If the latter method is used, two <span class="inlinecode">Random</span> objects having the same seed will generate the same sequence of numbers. The <span class="inlinecode">Random</span> class would generate random numbers using the following code fragment:</p>
<pre class=" code onetabindent">Random num = new Random(3);
for (int count = 0; count &lt; 5; count++) {
   System.out.print(20 + num.nextInt(9) + "  ");
}
</pre>
<p>As before, the five random numbers would be generated from the following values:</p>
<p class="onetabindent">20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
