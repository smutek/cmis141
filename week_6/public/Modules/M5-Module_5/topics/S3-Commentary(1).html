<h1>Module 5: Objects and Classes</h1>
<h4>A. Object Overview</h4>
<p>One example of using an object would be a program to determine an employee's pay, where that pay is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly pay rate. For the employee object, there would need to be two data fields&mdash;one for the hours worked and one for the pay rate per hour. There would also need to be behaviors that would give values to each of the data fields, as well as a behavior that calculates the pay for that employee. This scenario is represented by the following pseudocode:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">Object Employee definition
   Has data fields of
      Rate of pay
      Hours worked
   Has behaviors of
      Set rate of pay
      Set hours worked
      Calculate Pay
</pre>
<p>Using the pseudocode above, we can create the <span class="inlinecode">Employee</span> object. The class name would be <span class="inlinecode">Employee</span>. Its data fields would be <span class="inlinecode">payRate</span> and <span class="inlinecode">hoursWorked</span>. Both can be of the type <span class="inlinecode">double</span>. The behavior for the class will be defined by using methods to <span class="inlinecode">setPayRate</span>, <span class="inlinecode">setHoursWorked</span>, and <span class="inlinecode">calculatePay</span>. Additional information will be given about the creation of classes and the constructors (<span class="inlinecode">Employee()</span> and <span class="inlinecode">Employee(payRate: double, hoursWorked: double)</span> in section II-C of this module.</p>
<h4>B. Creating Objects and the <span class="courier">new</span> Operator</h4>
<p>To create an instance of a class, or an object, in Java, the <span class="inlinecode">new</span> operator is used. The <span class="inlinecode">new</span> operator does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It allocates space in which to store the data that will make up the Java object.</li>
<li>It then calls a special method, called a <em>constructor</em>, which initializes the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will illustrate the use of the <span class="inlinecode">new</span> operator using <span class="inlinecode">Employee</span> as we create an instance of it called <span class="inlinecode">employee1</span>.</p>
<p>Move your mouse over the highlighted lines to read the explanations.</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent"><a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[12])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;">Employee employee1;</span></a>
<a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[13])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;"> employee1 = new Employee(6.50, 12.5);</span></a></pre>
<p>We also can combine the two previous lines into one line:</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent"><a href="javascript:;" onmouseover="overlib(messages[14])" onmouseout="nd()" class="mouseovers"><span style="background-color: #ffff99;">Employee employee1 = new Employee(6.50, 12.5);</span></a></pre>
<h4>C. Objects Are Defined by a Class</h4>
<p>As we have seen in the previous section, one use of a class in Java is to create a type to define a variable. Because using a <span class="inlinecode">new</span> operation involves creating an instance of <span class="inlinecode">Employee</span>, it is sometimes called <em>instantiating</em> the object, and the object is called an <em>instance of the class</em>. Because an object is an instance of a class, the terms <em>object</em> and <em>instance</em> are used interchangeably in Java.</p>
<p>We saw that on some occasions when a variable for an object is declared, the object that corresponds to that variable is also created. Thus, one way to create two objects, <span class="inlinecode">employee1</span> and <span class="inlinecode">employee2</span>, which contain the values <span class="inlinecode">6.50</span> and <span class="inlinecode">12.5</span> in the first object and the values <span class="inlinecode">8.00</span> and <span class="inlinecode">17.50</span> in the second object, is shown in the following code fragment.</p>
<pre class="code onetabindent">Employee employee1 = new Employee(6.50, 12.5);
Employee employee2 = new Employee(8.00, 17.5);</pre>
<p>Later, we will make use of this concept to create a program.</p>
<h4>D. Differences between Objects and Primitives</h4>
<p>Not all variables in Java are primitives. As we just discussed, some variables are objects. In our example, we designed a class for <span class="inlinecode">Employee</span> and then created the object variables <span class="inlinecode">employee1</span> and <span class="inlinecode">employee2</span>. There are other object variables that are existing classes. These types are not defined in the core Java language and are not Java reserved words, but are defined in a Java class. Therefore, programmers can use existing classes or create their own to define types for variables. In fact, in Java it is common for programmers to define their own classes for variables to be used in their programs.</p>
<p>Examples of object variables that are not primitive are <span class="inlinecode">String</span>, <span class="inlinecode">Integer</span>, <span class="inlinecode">Double</span>, and <span class="inlinecode">Boolean</span>. In Java, you can generally tell if a variable is an object or a primitive by the case of the first letter of the type. For example, an <span class="inlinecode">int</span> is a primitive (because the first letter of the type is lowercase), but an <span class="inlinecode">Integer</span> is an object (because the first letter of the type is uppercase). This convention is a coding standard that most Java programmers follow.</p>
<p>Also, every primitive in Java (e.g., <span class="inlinecode">int</span> and <span class="inlinecode">boolean</span>) has a class associated with it (e.g., <span class="inlinecode">Integer</span> and <span class="inlinecode">Boolean</span>) called a <em>wrapper</em> class. A wrapper class is used to store behaviors about that type of object, such as converting a <span class="inlinecode">String</span> to <span class="inlinecode">int</span>, as with the <span class="inlinecode">parseInt</span> method used in the following code fragment:</p>
<p class="code onetabindent">anIntNum = Integer.parseInt("89");</p>
<p>The <span class="inlinecode">parseInt</span> method converts a <span class="inlinecode">String</span> into an <span class="inlinecode">int</span> value. Also, the <span class="inlinecode">parseInt</span> method is in the wrapper class <span class="inlinecode">Integer</span>, as shown by the placement of the <span class="inlinecode">Integer</span> class on the left-hand side of the dot operator, as we explained earlier.</p>
<p>For <span class="inlinecode">double</span> conversion, the <span class="inlinecode">parseDouble</span> method is available. The following code fragment shows how it might be used to convert a <span class="inlinecode">String</span> into a <span class="inlinecode">double</span> value:</p>
<p class="code onetabindent">aDoubleNum = Double.parseDouble("89.5");</p>
