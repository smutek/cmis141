<p class="figuretitle"><span class="inlinecode">VariableModifiers</span></p>

<p>As with local variables and methods, modifiers can also be associated with a 
variable associated with a class. These 
modifiers are <span class="inlinecode">static</span>, <span class="inlinecode">final</span>, 
<span class="inlinecode">public</span>, <span class="inlinecode">private</span>, 
and <span class="inlinecode">protected</span>. The use of the modifier 
<span class="inlinecode">static</span> makes the variable a class variable, not 
an instance variable. </p>

<p>Static variables are never instance 
variables, so <span class="inlinecode">static</span> should never be used as a 
modifier for instance variables. Also, the <span class="inlinecode">protected</span> modifier has 
meaning only when inheritance is used, so we will not consider it in this course.</p>

<p>We have already discussed the <span class="inlinecode">final</span> modifier, 
which gives a variable a fixed value. The variable cannot be changed if it is 
used with a primitive that is an instance variable, so a <span class="inlinecode">final</span> 
variable will be effectively the same for every object. Because there is no ability to store 
data with each object using a <span class="inlinecode">final</span> variable that is a primitive, 
the <span class="inlinecode">final</span> modifier should never be used with an instance 
variable that is a primitive.</p>

<p>There are uses of the <span class="inlinecode">final</span> modifier for object instance 
variables, but these are related to how the Java VM handles some specific issues that are 
outside the scope of this course. So the use of the <span class="inlinecode">final</span> 
modifier will not be considered with instance variables.</p>

<p>Therefore, the only modifiers that will be used in this class 
with instance variables are <span class="inlinecode">private</span> and 
<span class="inlinecode">public</span>. As we mentioned earlier, it is considered bad form to 
declare a variable as anything but <span class="inlinecode">private</span>.</p>
